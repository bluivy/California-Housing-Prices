The project uses Artificial Neural network to predict the housing prices in the state of California,United States Of America
the dataset used in the project is a sample dataset provided in the Google colaboratory. I used the training data. It has 3000 values and split them into training and testing set.


I used tensorflow, keras to construct the neural network.
